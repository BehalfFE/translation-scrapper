# translation-scrapper
Will scrap translations, hopefully

Usage:
Run the script in your project folde.
The script will review the current revision delta from the master branch.
Currently a list consisting the category and key from each finding will be provided

Still requrie development:
- Multi line translation method usage
- Handling optional placeholders (parameters)
- Rendering the results list to something useful (MySQL script, CSV, etc.)
